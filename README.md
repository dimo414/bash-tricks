Utilities, links, and information on writing performant, safe code in the Bash shell language

This repository contains things useful for someone programming [Bash](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bash-intro.html) at scale. "Bash at scale" and "Bash codebase" are phrases that I have the unfortunate privilege of uttering (unironically) daily.

This repository will eventually contain snippets of production-ready Bash code* that I and my colleagues have found useful.
